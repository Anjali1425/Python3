# 1. Use for, .split(), and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':
#st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'

st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'
words = st.split()
for n in words:
    if n.startswith("s"):
        print(n)

# 2. Use range() to print all the even numbers from 0 to 10.

even = range(0,10,2)
for x in even:
    print(x)

OR list(range(0,11,2))

# 3. Use a List Comprehension to create a list of all numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 3.

num = range(0,50)
for x in num:
    if x%3==0:
        print(x)

# 4. Go through the string below and if the length of a word is even print "even!"
#st = 'Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'

st = 'Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters'
words = st.split()
for word in words:
    if len(word)%2==0:
        print(word)

# 5. Use List Comprehension to create a list of the first letters of every word in the string #below:
#st = 'Create a list of the first letters of every word in this string'
str = st.split()
for x in str:
    print x
